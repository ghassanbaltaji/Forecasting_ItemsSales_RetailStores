# Forecasting_ItemsSales_RetailStores
Predicting quantity of Items to be sold for the upcoming 30 days
The task of this project is to predict the total quantity/item/day for the next 30 days
2 datasets are given, so first I merged them to form a single dataset
I applied Multiple Linear Regression model and I got an adjusted R-squared=0.8074

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.


Adjusted R2 is a corrected goodness-of-fit (model accuracy) measure for linear models. It identifies the percentage of variance in the target field that is explained by the input or inputs.
The lowest R-squared is 0 and means that the points are not explained by the regression whereas the highest R-squared is 1 and means that all the points are explained by the regression line. For example, an R-squared of 0.8074 means that the regression explains 80.74% of the variation in our y-variable.
Generally, a higher adjusted R-squared indicates a better fit of the regression model to the data. However, the acceptable value varies among different fields and applications. In practice, researchers often consider values above 0.7 or 0.8 as reasonably good fits.
